\section{Topology Requirements}
The electrical, gas, and water topology shall be modeled as directed graphs with
nodes representing buses, gas, or water nodes, and edges representing electrical
connections, gas, or water pipelines. Whenever applicable, the positivity of a
numeric quantity shall be logically associated with the direction of an edge.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Buses in the electrical topology shall have approximately equal
  voltages. If there are transformer zones, they shall be normalized to the same
  voltage level.

\item Despite the presence of compressor stations to compensate for friction
  losses over pipelines, gas nodes shall have approximately equal pressure
  levels and temperatures to ignore the effect of compression on volumetric flow
  and heat content.

\item Water pumps shall create positive flow in the on state, and no flow in the
  off state.
\end{enumerate}
