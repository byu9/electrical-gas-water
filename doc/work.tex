\section{Work Breakdown Structure}
\begin{itemize}


\item Xiaochu
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To convert the mathematical problem to a form that benefits the
    implementation of the program or the applicability of external software
    components to the purpose of the program.
  \item To review changes to the source code and ensure the state of coherency
    between the source code and \gls{this}.
  \item To resolve questions and ambiguities discovered by the implementer.
  \end{itemize}



\item John
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To update \gls{this} to reflect the mathematical formulation of the
    problem.
  \item To implement \gls{this} as a Python program and maintain
    symbol-identifier resemblance wherever possible, and to maintain the program
    to reflect any changes in \gls{this}.
  \item To update the program according to the proposal of a reviewer.
  \item To raise any ambiguities and potential problems of \gls{this} to the
    attention of the modeler.
  \end{itemize}
