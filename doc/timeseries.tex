\section{Scheduling Horizon}

\paragraph{Scheduling Interval}
The scheduling interval shall be 1 \gls{unit:t}.

\paragraph{Scheduling Horizon}
The scheduling horizon shall contain an incremental time series of zero to an
arbitrary number of timepoints with a uniform sampling period equal to the
scheduling interval. The first timepoint in the scheduling horizon is the
\emph{initial timepoint}. Initial conditions given as constants implicitly apply
to the scheduling interval ending at the initial timepoint.

\paragraph{Extended Scheduling Horizon}
The extended scheduling horizon shall include the scheduling interval ending
with the initial timepoint, whose beginning is hereby referred to as the
\emph{extended initial timepoint}. The extended initial timepoint indexes the
value of the initial condition of a symbol set.
